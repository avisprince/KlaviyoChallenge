# Klaviyo Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


## To run:
1. Clone the project
2. Navigate to KlaviyoChallenge\klaviyo-challenge
3. Run - npm install
4. Run - npm start

*** The above instructions require Node.js to be installed. ***


## Project Notes:
- This project utilizes [React-Grid-Layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-grid-layout) for creating and displaying the templates
- The project code is organized to allow for more features to be added such as undo/redo, more block types, and more text editing features
- I didn't add subtext editing (such as bolding only part of a text) because I felt it was out of the scope of this project. Instead editing a text block will update all of the text every time.
- I only added a few text editing features, but I felt that it is clear from the code how more can be added.
